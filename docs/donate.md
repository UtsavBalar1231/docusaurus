# Donate {#donate}

IMMENSITY is a [pure Open Source](https://GitHub.com/UtsavBalar1231/kernel_xiaomi_sm8250) project and doesn't charge any kind of credits for its builds and releases.
Its true that the developer is putting effort for providing a stable and good custom kernel that's easy to flash and doesn't harm the device's stability

If you found my work useful and want to continue supporting development contribute by becoming

- A [**Patron**](https://www.patreon.com/utsavthecunt) for early releases and better support.
- You can also provide a small donation through [**PayPal**](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/utsavbalar)
- Indian users can support through **UPI:** `utsavbalar1231@oksbi`

Please consider a donation for IMMENSITY because it will help me offer support in the long term.
Its fine even if you can't afford it :) alternatively consider providing a thanks on XDA thread.
