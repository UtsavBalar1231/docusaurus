### Download

:::caution
Only for AOSP/CAF based Custom ROMs

`Avoid flashing this kernel on hentaiOS`

[**Download**](https://github.com/UtsavBalar1231/kernel_xiaomi_sm8250/releases/tag/0.4.j)
:::

### Installation

- Download the latest build on your device
- Reboot into TWRP
- Select the kernel zip file and flash

**Or**

- Flash from FKM if you are rooted

:::tip
Currently Most of the apollo specific ROMs are using Pixel Powerhal, so performance across apollo devices
in comparison with other devices may differ and you might face issues like frequencies stuck at one level.

so for The best compatibility it is recommended to use a CAF based ROMs like aospa/p404.

In future updates the kernel will add compatibity for apollo roms that are using official LOS device trees.

Its always a good sign to keep backup of your boot image before flashing any kernel.
